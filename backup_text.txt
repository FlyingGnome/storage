However, this study was not originally planned with full fold-level archival of intermediate predictions and metrics. As a result:
1. Some of the required per-fold raw outputs are no longer available,
2. Which makes it impossible to compute confidence intervals and paired tests retrospectively for all backbone–scale combinations.
We now clearly acknowledge this limitation in the manuscript.
At the same time, we recognize the importance of this methodology for future research. Therefore we added a statement in the Discussion (Limitations and Future Research) that future experiments will include full fold-level logging
